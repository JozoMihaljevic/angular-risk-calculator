# Angular5calculator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8.

My commercial project made for medical institution.
It's health risk calculator that gives risk rate and health advice based on body measurements and blood tests.
Live version can be viewed <a href="http://rizik.poliklinika-analiza.hr/" target="_blank">
here</a>.
It was built with Angular2+, Bootstrap and jQuery.

Here on GitHub I'm doing refactoring and transferring app to Angular, without jQuery.
